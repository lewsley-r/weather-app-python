**CHECKLIST**
   
1. Weather API Integration: Use a weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI) to fetch current weather data and forecasts. You'll need to sign up for an API key to access the data.

2. User Input: Allow users to input their location (city or zip code) to get the weather forecast for that location.

3. Display Weather Information: Once the user inputs their location, display relevant weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).

4. Forecast: Provide a forecast for the upcoming days (e.g., next 5 days) so users can plan ahead.

5. Graphical Representation: You could use libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly to create graphical representations of the weather data, such as temperature trends over time.

6. Error Handling: Implement error handling in case the user enters an invalid location or there's an issue with the API request.

7. User-Friendly Interface: Design a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with your application.

8. Documentation: Provide clear documentation on how to use your application, including any dependencies and setup instructions.
